# Results

This folder contains **small, reproducible outputs** produced by the pipeline / notebooks.

## Files

- `backtest.csv`  
  Output from the demo backtest (generated by `notebooks/exploratory.ipynb`).

## Notes

- Large intermediate artifacts (full covariance matrices, plots for many windows, etc.) are **not** committed.
- If you run the pipeline locally, you can configure output paths in the scripts under `experiments/`.
